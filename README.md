# SF City Meters 
### An Experiment in Buidling Data Driven Tools to Understand San Francisco

## What makes it an experiment? 
Open source allows people to come together and create something new.
SF City Meters will be open to all ideas. 
Anyone can contribute (even if you can't code).

## Anyone can contribute
Open source code tends to be restricted to people who know how to code.
SF City Meters will accept ideas or suggestions from anyone. Issues can be sent to <a href="https://rysolv.com" title="Rysolv.com Fund Open Source Issues">Rysolv.com</a> where they can be crowdfunded and built.

## How do I contribute? 
### To suggestion ideas?
Just click the pen symbol to edit this page and submit an idea. You can add your ideas to the list below.
### To add to the code: 
Right now the project is all html and vanilla JS. Check the "Issues" tab for items which need to be built, or browse our issues on <a href="https://rysolv.com/repos/detail/7f5537b7-fe09-4491-856e-000df7189484">Rysolv</a>

## Current Ideas (Add to this list!)
