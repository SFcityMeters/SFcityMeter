# SF City Meters

This project will create meters using data from 
https://data.sfgov.org/

We will start using the 311 data reports of human and animal waste to create a poop-meter
https://data.sfgov.org/browse?Department-Metrics_Publishing-Department=311

For those not familiar you can report issues in SF using the 311 app here:
https://sf311.org/

Details on the API are here:

# Data

We will use the 311 API And maybe MySQL later


# Front End
Currently just html and vanilla JS.
Maybe a Node JS/Express site later rendered with handlebars
